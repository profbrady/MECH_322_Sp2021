    "\n",
    "*Arduinos* are micro-controllers that can be programmed to control physical devices. In the words of one of the founders, Massimo Banzi, in his book *Getting Started with Arduino*, “*Arduino* is an open source physical computing platform based on a simple input/output (I/O) board and a development environment that implements the Processing language (www.processing.org). *Arduino* can be used to develop standalone interactive objects or can be connect to software on your computer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Adafruit Industries is currently a manufacturer of US made/sold *Arduino* boards. They modified the design of an *Arduino* board to accept a different processor that can run a version of *Python* called **CircuitPython** (https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?) that does essentially the same tasks as the *Arduino* software. We will be using two of the many available *CircuitPython* boards to learn how to use *Python* to program the real world. Our boards are the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/overview) and [Metro M0 Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython?view=all). Follow the links to see how to get/update *CircuitPython* on the boards to get up and running.\n",

The following example shows how it might be used. It turns on an LED and then runs a loop in which the value of **`time.monotonic()`** is checked each pass to see if 3 seconds has elapsed. If it has, the LED is changed to the opposite state and the static comparison time **`time_old`** is given a new value.

In this case, one leg of the switch needs to be wired to the digital pin and the other leg to ground.
