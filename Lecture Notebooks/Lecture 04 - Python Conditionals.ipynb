    "\n",
    "As we have seen previously, script files in their simplest form are a list of commands that are executed in order; one after the other, from top to bottom. However, quite often it is necessary for a script to make decisions based on the values assigned to variables or to execute a group of commands more than once. Changing the flow of a script requires that some sort of decision making be added within the script. The addition of decision making processes is one of the primary differences between simple and complex scripts. Comparison and logical operators are a necessary part of the decision making process. They are used as part of every conditional statement that alters the flow of a script. The *Python* conditional statements introduced here are the `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statement groups."

    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add the ability for a script to make decisions, we need to compare values and/or variables. Doing so requires an understanding of comparison and logical operators. Comparison operators compare two values and should be familiar to most. They include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operator | Description | Example | Result |\n",
    "|:-----|:----------|:---|:---|\n",
    "|`<`  | is the left side value less than the right | `3 < 5` | `True`|\n",
    "|`>`  | is the left side value greater than the right | `3 > 5` | `False`|\n",
    "|`<=` | is the left value less than or equal to the right | `2 <= 4/2` | `True`|\n",
    "|`>=` | is the left value greater than or equal to the right | `4**2 >= 15` | `True`|\n",
    "|`==` | are the two values equal to each other | `2 + 2 == 2*2` | `True`|\n",
    "|`!=` | are the two values not equal to each other | `16**(1/2) != 4` | `False`|\n",
    "|`is` | is one object the same as another (different than `==`) | `2.0 is 2` | `False`|\n",
    "|`is not` | is one object not the same as the other | `2.0 is  not 2` | `True`|\n",
    "|`in` | is one object in (a sub-set of) the other | `'e' in 'yes'` | `True`|\n",
    "|`not in` | is one object not in the other | `'i' not in 'team'` | `True`|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators can be used to compare two objects; usually numbers in our case, but can also include strings and other objects. The result of these comparisons is either `True` or `False`. Mathematical operators take precedence over comparison operators, and comparison operators all have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right. Therefore, it is important to use parentheses to group portions of expressions to ensure the desired comparison is made. When using the `in` and `not in` operators, the second object (the one after the operator) must be what *Python* refers to as an iterable. Strings are iterables, as are lists, tuples, and ranges; each of which will be introduced later."
