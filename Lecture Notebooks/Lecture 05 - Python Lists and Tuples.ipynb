    "*Python* has a number of data types that are used to hold multiple objects. Each type stores and accesses the objects it contains in different ways and for different reasons. Two of these types are **lists** and **tuples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be used to store different object types, such as integers, floats, and strings; all in the same data structure. They can even include lists and other data types as well, allowing you to create a lists of lists if desired. Lists are defined by surrounding the objects with square brackets `[]` and separating the objects with commas. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4.5, \"knights\", [5, 6, 7]]` is a valid list definition. Most of the time lists will contain either just numeric values or strings for our purposes, not a mix of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty lists are created by using an empty set of square brackets, i.e. `empty_list = []`. You can also create an empty list using the `list()` function, like so `empty_list = list()`. These will come in handy at times, so it is good information to know."

    "## Creating Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples** are constructed similarly to lists. Instead of using square brackets, parentheses are used; for example `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`. Tuples can contain the same mix of data types as lists do.  Sometimes you can also create a tuple without using the parentheses, but using parentheses is preferred for clarity. We have already used tuples when we created functions that return more than one value. For our purposes, that is about all they will be used for. They will also pop up again when creating $(x, y)$ and $(x, y, z)$ vectors. Lists and some other data types can be turned into tuples using the `tuple()` function. One curious thing about tuples is that you can create them with only one item by simply placing a single comma after the item, i.e. `my_tuple = (4,)`."

    "## The `range()` and `list()` Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often we will need a list of evenly spaced integers in scripts or functions. We could do it manually by typing the numbers into a list. However, the *Pythonic* approach is to use a function that is specifically designed for this purpose; `range()`. The `range()` function accepts up to three integer arguments and creates what is referred to as an iterable sequence (related to a list). If only one argument is used, i.e. `range(x)`, *Python* creates an iterable sequence that includes all integers from `0` up to `x-1`. For example, `range(10)` creates an iterable of all integers from 0 to 9, inclusive. It is easy to turn an iterable into a list (if needed) using the `list()` function. For example, `list(range(10))` creates the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`."

The step size for this iterable is still `1`, so all integers from 5 to 9 will be included in this range.\n",

The range starts with the first value and goes up to but does not include the ending value using the provided step size.

    "Lists in *Python* are considered to be **mutable** meaning that you can change (mutate) the contents of a list once it is created. In fact, the term mutable comes form the same root word as mutute.

For example, `my_list[4] = 12` will replace the value in the 4th index position of `my_list` with the value `12`. You can change multiple items using the list slicing syntax, i.e. `my_list[:5] = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]` will replace the first $5$ values with the objects from the provided list."

    "### Methods for Adding and Removing List Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with the methods that are used to add and remove objects from lists. Following is list of the methods we will look at.\n",
    "- `.append()`\n",
    "- `.extend()`\n",
    "- `.insert()`\n",
    "- `.clear()`\n",
    "- `.pop()`\n",
    "- `.remove()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.append()` method adds a single object to the end of list. For the list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `my_list.append(5)` would result in the list being changed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. If you try to add a list using `.append([6, 7])` for example, the list will be appended as a single object, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 7]]`. This may not have been what you had hoped for. Instead, you may have wanted to use the `.extend()` method; which takes a list as an argument and extends the original list with the items from the argument list. For example, using the original `my_list` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `my_list.extend([5, 6, 7])` results in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Python* also allows you to add objects at any other location in a list, not just the end. This is handled by the `.insert()` method. This method requires two arguments; the index position where the insertion takes place and the inserted object. The new object will be inserted before the index position given. Again, using `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `my_list.insert(3,12)` will place the value `12` just before the value `4` which is located at the 3rd index position. This results in the list being changed to `[1, 2, 3, 12, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.clear()` method acts a bit like the the `del()` function, but instead of deleting the entire list, it deletes all of the items in the list; leaving behind an empty list. For example, `my_list.clear()` results in `my_list` being converted to an empty list `[]`, regardless of what was originally in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `.pop()` and `.remove()` are used to remove objects from lists. If the `.pop()` method is used without any arguments it will remove the last object from the list and return its value. If an argument is used, then that index position is removed and returned. An error is generated if the index position specified does not exist. The following code sample shows how `.pop()` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> a = my_list.pop()\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> my_list\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `.remove()` method removes the first occurance of the value given as an argument. Using `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `my_list.remove(2)` will remove the first `2` found in the list. This would result in the list `[1, 3, 4]`."

    "### Methods for Counting, Searching, and Changing Order\n",
    "\n",
    "*Python* provides a number of list methods that are related to counting, searching, and changing the order of lists. The following list of methods will be introduced.\n",
    "- `.count()`\n",
    "- `.index()`\n",
    "- `.sort()`\n",
    "- `.reverse()`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can count the number of times that a specific object (value, string, etc.) appears in a list by using the `.count()` method. This method requires one argument, the object that you are counting. For example, using `my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, the command `my_list.count(2)` will return the value `2` but `my_list.count(8)` will return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding an object in a list requires use of the `.index()` method. It will search for the object in the list and return the index position of the first occurance of the object. If the object is not found in the list, then an error will be generated. It might be better to use `.count()` first to ensure that the object is in the list or simply use the `in` comparison. If `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, using the expression `7 in my_list` will return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the search object occurs more than once, only the position of the first occurrence is reported by the `.index()` method. However, this method also accepts optional starting and ending arguments. The command `my_list.index(3, 3, 5)` will return the index for the first location in `my_list` that `3` is found (if it is found) starting with the 3rd index position and ending just before the 5th index position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.sort()` method for lists will sort the list in ascending order by default. This works for both numeric and string values, but not a mix of both. Keep in mind that the sorted list replaces the original instead of making a copy. Adding the optional keyword argument `reverse=True` will sort the list in descending order instead, i.e. `my_list.sort(reverse=True)`. There is a related function called `sorted()` that creates a sorted copy of the list. This function will also accepts the `reverse=True` keyword argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.reverse()` method will flip the order of a list, making the last item the first. This method replaces the original list with the modified list as well. Using the related `reversed()` function makes an iterator that is a reversed version of the orignal list. You need to use the `list()` function to convert the resulting iterator into an actual list if that is what you need."

    "## The `.zip()` Function and Making Tables from Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often you will have lists of values/data that you would like to display together in tabular form. If you just print a list, say `print([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, all of the values will be on the same line inside square brackets and separated by commas. If you try to print two related lists, i.e. `print([1, 2, 3, 4, 5],[6, 7, 8, 9, 10])`, you get basically the same thing except with two lists on the same line. The *Python* function `zip()` can be used to connect two or more lists together much like the teeth in a zipper. This function creates a special iterable object that can be converted to a standard list. In order to print one of these objects and see the values, it has to be converted to a list first.\n",

To do so, a  module named `tabulate` was created. Within this module is a function called `tabulate()` that needs to be passed into a `print()` function. The website https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate gives a complete overview of the available options for this function. The following code cell shows an example that creates a fancy looking table with the values from the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other choices for the `tablefmt=` option are `\"simple\"`, `\"grid\"`, and `\"plain\"`. You can also set the row alignment as `\"center\"` or `\"left\"` by adding the `numalign=` argument to the `tabulate` function. The argument `floatfmt=(\".1f\",\".2f\")` would show the first column with one-decimal place and the second with two if both contained floating point values. Any float formatting expression can be used with this argument. Execute the code cell and feel free to change and/or add arguments.\n",
