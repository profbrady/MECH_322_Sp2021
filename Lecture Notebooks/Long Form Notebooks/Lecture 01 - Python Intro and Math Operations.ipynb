Code cells that have been executed will have a number added to the identifier on the left, i.e. **`In [1]:`** for the first cell executed during a session. The corresponding output cell will also have an identifier with a number that matches the input cell that caused the output, i.e. **`Out[1]:`** belongs to **`In [1]:`**. There are occasions where an output cell is not generated because the code in the input cell does not create one. In these instances, the output identifier numbering will still be incremented so that all input/output pairs maintain the same number throughout a notebook.\n",

    "The *Jupyter* inteface uses colors to identify if a cell is in **edit mode** or **command mode**.

In this mode you are free to type *Python* commands when in a code cell or text if in a *Markdown* cell.\n",

We can use this mode to manage what the notebook looks like, i.e. the order of existing cells, adding new cells, or deleting cells. Always make sure you are in edit mode before you start typing *Python* commands. If you are not in edit mode and start typing, strange things may happen to your notebook since *Jupyter* uses single-letter shortcuts for most commands when in command mode. \n",

    "You will want to be aware of what mode a cell is in before typing anything. In some *Jupyter* environments cells can be protected from deletion and/or editing, but those protections are ignored in other environments. For example, if using the web-based *Jupyter* environment, such protections are enforced. But *Visual Studio Code's Jupyter* environment ignores such protections.\n",

    "In order to enter edit mode and type *Python* commands (or edit any existing cell) you can double-click anywhere in a code cell. Also, pressing the **`[enter]`** (**`[return]`** key when in command mode will cause the current blue highlighted cell to switch from command to edit mode and change the border color to green. After a *Python* command (or group of commands) has been typed in a code cell, you need to press both the **`[shift]`** and **`[enter]`** keys at the same time to execute the commands. This will signal the notebook to execute the commands in the cell and generate any applicable output. The **`[enter]`** key on its own just creates a new line within a cell.\n",

    "You can leave a code cell without executing it simply by clicking on any other cell or outside of the current cell.

    "All cells in a notebook may be edited, not just code cells. Switching between edit and command mode is done the same way regardless of the cell type. *Jupyter* uses a system for formatting text called *Markdown*. Any cell can be converted to a *Markdown* cell by pressing the **M** key while in command mode (blue border).

They also allow th linking of image files that are located in the same directory as the notebook file. In class *Markdown* cells will be used extensively for these purposes. When you are done editing the text in a *Markdown* cell, press **`[shift]+[enter]`** just like you would to execute a code cell. This will execute the formatting instructions in the *Markdown* cell and generate formatted text. You will be able to differentiate between executed and non-executed *Markdown* cells fairly easily. *Markdown* cells that have been executed will have nice looking text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common *Markdown* symbols to created formatted text include:\n",
    "- `*` before and after text for *italic* text\n",
    "- `**` before and after text for **bold** text\n",
    "- `$` before and after special code that generates mathematical formulas; i.e. $\\beta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n",
    "- `-` or `*` followed by a space at the beginning of a line for a bullet\n",
    "- `#` followed by a space at the beginning of a line for a title (first order heading)\n",
    "- `##` followed by a space at the beginning of a line for a 2nd order heading\n",

    "- `___` at the beginning of a line for a horizontal line\n",

    "Raw cells will be used less frequently than the other two types. Raw cells may be used to show sample code. These types of cells are not executable. They will not produce results like code cells and will not look polished like *Markdown* cells. When executed with **`[shift]+[enter]`**, raw cells will look like code cells without the identifier on the left side and no results. Any cell can be converted to a raw cell by typing **R** while in command mode (blue outline)."

    "*Python* will allow you to convert objects of one type into objects of another type if it makes sense to do so. Floats can be converted to integers using **`int()`**, but everything right of the decimal and the decimal itself will be stripped off the value. All integers can be converted to floats using **`float()`** and a decimal point and zero will be added to the end. Both floats and integers can be converted to strings with the **`str()`** function. A string that only contains an integer value can be converted to an integer, but a string that only contains a floating point value cannot be converted directly to an integer. However, a string that only contains a floating point value can be converted to a float. To convert string containing a float into an integer, you need to first convert the string to float, then to an integer. "

This should not be done in a script or a function, but for quick calulations it can be helpful. It acts like the \"ans\" key on your calculator.\n",

It returns a list of all current names and modules in memory. The built-in command **`dir()`** does the same thing but also includes a lot of extraneous information, making **`who`** cleaner to use when using a *Jupyter* notebook. The magic command **`whos`** is similar to **`who`** except that it also includes information on types and values associated with variable names."
