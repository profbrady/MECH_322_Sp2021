For example, when we previously used the **`abs()`** function, we would pass a value to it for which we wanted to get the absolute value. The expression **`abs(-100)`** passes **`-100`** as an argument to the absolute value function. Functions can also be included inside a script or as part of a module. If a function is defined within a script, it must be done before the function is called (used) in the script. Good programming practice says to place all **`import`** statements at the beginning of scripts and all user-defined functions immediately thereafter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a variable name is assigned in a *Python* script it is available for use in commands further down in the script. On the other hand, argument names passed into and used in a function are only available to use inside the function. The results generated from performing calculations in scripts can be displayed/output either using the **`print()`** function or by writing output values to a text file, although only the first will be used at this time. User-defined functions utilize these techniques as well, but more often they just return results back to the calling location. For example, **`abs(-100)`** returns the value **`100`** but does not print the result. Not all user-defined functions return values though. Those that do not are sometimes called **void functions** and those that do are sometimes called **fruitful functions**.\n",

You, the programmer, will have to make sure that all of the commands in the script are error free and that the script provides the necessary and correct output in an understandable manner. Script files and user-defined functions should include a liberal dose of comments so the programmer and others can understand why things are being done a particular way in the event that changes need to be made in the future."

In order to return a value (or values) fruitful functions need to have a **`return`** statement. The **`return`** is typically located on the last line of a function since *Python* exits the function as soon as a value is returned. More than one value can be returned from a function by including multiple values separated by commas after the **`return`** statement.  Keep in mind that unlike the **`print()`** function, **`return`** is a statement (not a function) and does not use parentheses.
