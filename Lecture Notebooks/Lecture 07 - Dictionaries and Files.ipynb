    "Recall that lists and tuples can be used to hold a number of objects or values. For example, `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, \"Python\", 10.3, 56.78, math.pi, (3, 4, 5)]` is a list that contains integers, floats, a string, $\\pi$, and a tuple. We can access the items in lists (and tuples) using indexing and slicing. You can use `my_list[4]` to access the string `\"Python\"` or `my_list[:4]` to access `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Tuples work the same as lists except they use parentheses, not square brackets, to enclose the values. Hopefully you remember that lists are mutable (can be altered by changing, adding, or removing objects) and tuples are not."

    "## Introduction to Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are similar to lists in that they can be used to contain or collect a variety of objects. They are mutable like lists and can contain a variety of object types; such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and even other dictionaries. The primary difference between dictionaries and lists is how the objects within them are stored and accessed. We access objects in a list by their position within the list, such as `my_list[2]`. Dictionaries do not rely upon position to access objects. The items in dictionaries are stored in what are called key-value pairs and the values are accessed via the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary keys must be immutable objects; such as strings, integers, floats, or tuples. You cannot use lists or other dictionaries as keys. Values are linked to keys instead of index positions, so keys within a dictionary must be unique. This means that you cannot have more than one of any specific key. Values can be nearly any object type, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, and tuples.\n",

You can also use the function `dict()` to create an empty dictionary. Once you have an empty dictionary, you can add key-value pairs via indexing the dictionary name with a key and assigning it a value. For example, `MECH_classes['MECH 111'] = 'MET Seminar'` creates the key-value pair `'MECH 111':'MET Seminar'` within the dictionary `MECH_classes`.

Lists can be used in many places where dictionaries are used, but quite often not as easily or effectively. For instance, say you want to access material properties of specific common engineering materials in a script. You could make one list of material names and a number associated lists with each property value. Then you could search the material name list for the material you need and return its index position. Then use that index position to access the material property you need from the appropriate list. However, what happens if you want to add or remove a material? You have to change every list and hope you don't miss one.\n",

Often you may want to save the objects you have created so they will be available the next time you run the script or you may want to get and use values or information from a file that you or somebody else previously created. This might include test results saved from an instrument or machine, tables of material properties, steam tables, a dictionary of books, articles, or standards, or a text file. *Python* has built-in functions and methods for reading and writing information from/to files. We will look at using text files that can be opened with any standard text editor, even if information in the files are organized differently for each use case.\n",

You can add a mode as a second argument to the function call to explicitly state how the file will be used. The default is for reading `\"r\"`, but you can also use `\"w\"` for writing, `\"a\"` for appending, and `\"r+\"` for reading and writing.

It does exactly the same thing as the previous method, except anything that you do with the file needs to be indented under the `with` expression. The benefit of using the `with` method is that as soon as the code block below it is exited (finished) the file is automatically closed.

    "It would be much nicer if there were a more direct way to access the values from CSV files. Well, there is. The `csv` module was designed to handle this specific task. We need to use `with` to open a CSV file and assign it a name. Then use `csv.reader()` with the file object as an argument plus `quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` as a keyword argument. The `quoting` keyword tells the reader how to handle quoted items. In this case, it converts non-quoted items into floats. The new CSV object can be converted to a list so the required values can be extracted. In this case two list comprehensions were used to extract the x and y values and place them in their own lists."

A DataFrames uses the heading names from the CSV file it was created from as indexes for the DataFrame; kind of like dictionary keys. In this case the headings are `\"x\"` and `\"y\"`. Therefore, `csv_df[\"x\"]` will return all of the values from the `\"x\"` column as a *Pandas* Series. Using the `list()` function allows us to convert the Series to a list; i.e. `x = list(csv_df[\"x\"]`.\n",
