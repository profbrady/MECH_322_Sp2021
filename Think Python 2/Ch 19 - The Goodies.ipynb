    "# Chapter 19: The Goodies\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my goals for this book has been to teach you as little Python as possible. When there were two ways to do something, I picked one and avoided mentioning the other. Or sometimes I put the second one into an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I want to go back for some of the good bits that got left behind. Python provides a number of features that are not really necessary--you can write good code without them--but with them you can sometimes write code that’s more concise, readable or efﬁcient, and sometimes all three.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19.1 Conditional expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw conditional statements in Section 5.4. Conditional statements are often used to choose one of two values; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        y = math.log(x)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        y = float('nan')\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement checks whether `x` is positive. If so, it computes `math.log`. If not, `math.log` would raise a ValueError. To avoid stopping the program, we generate a “NaN”, which is a special ﬂoating-point value that represents “Not a Number”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this statement more concisely using a **conditional expression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = math.log(x) if x > 0 else float('nan')\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost read this line like English: “y gets log-x if x is greater than 0; otherwise it gets NaN”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions can sometimes be rewritten using conditional expressions. For example, here is a recursive version of factorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def factorial(n):\n",
    "        if n == 0:\n",
    "            return 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return n * factorial(n-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def factorial(n):\n",
    "        return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use of conditional expressions is handling optional arguments. For example, here is the init method from `GoodKangaroo` (see Exercise 17.2):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        if contents == None:\n",
    "            contents = []\n",
    "        self.pouch_contents = contents\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite this one like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.pouch_contents = [] if contents == None else contents\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can replace a conditional statement with a conditional expression if both branches contain simple expressions that are either returned or assigned to the same variable.\n"

    "## 19.2 List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 10.7 we saw the map and ﬁlter patterns. For example, this function takes a list of strings, maps the string method `capitalize` to the elements, and returns a new list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def capitalize_all(t):\n",
    "        res = []\n",
    "        for s in t:\n",
    "            res.append(s.capitalize())\n",
    "        return res\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this more concisely using a **list comprehension**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def capitalize_all(t):\n",
    "        return [s.capitalize() for s in t]\n",
    "\n",
    "The bracket operators indicate that we are constructing a new list. The expression inside the brackets speciﬁes the elements of the list, and the for clause indicates what sequence we are traversing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a list comprehension is a little awkward because the loop variable, `s` in this example, appears in the expression before we get to the deﬁnition.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can also be used for ﬁltering. For example, this function selects only the elements of `t` that are upper case, and returns a new list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def only_upper(t):\n",
    "        res = [] for s in t:\n",
    "        if s.isupper():\n",
    "            res.append(s)\n",
    "        return res\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite it using a list comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "    def only_upper(t):\n",
    "        return [s for s in t if s.isupper()]\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions. And they are usually faster than the equivalent `for` loops, sometimes much faster. So if you are mad at me for not mentioning them earlier, I understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in my defense, list comprehensions are harder to debug because you can’t put a `print` statement inside the loop. I suggest that you use them only if the computation is simple enough that you are likely to get it right the ﬁrst time. And for beginners that means never."

    "## 19.3 Generator expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator expressions** are similar to list comprehensions, but with parentheses instead of square brackets:\n",

    "    >>> g\n",
    "    <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f4c45a786c0>\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a generator object that knows how to iterate through a sequence of values. But unlike a list comprehension, it does not compute the values all at once; it waits to be asked. The built-in function `next` gets the next value from the generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> next(g)\n",
    "    0\n",
    "    >>> next(g)\n",
    "    1\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to the end of the sequence, `next` raises a StopIteration exception. You can also use a `for` loop to iterate through the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> for val in g:\n",
    "    ...     print(val)\n",
    "    4\n",
    "    9\n",
    "    16\n",

    "    >>> next(g)\n",
    "    StopIteration\n",

    "\n",
    "    >>> any([False, False, True])\n",

    "\n",
    "That example isn’t very useful because it does the same thing as the `in` operator. But we could use any to rewrite some of the search functions we wrote in Section 9.3. For example, we could write `avoids` like this:\n",

    "## 19.5 Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 13.6 I use dictionaries to ﬁnd the words that appear in a document but not in a word list. The function I wrote takes `d1`, which contains the words from the document as keys, and `d2`, which contains the list of words. It returns a dictionary that contains the keys from `d1` that are not in `d2`.\n",

    "        return res\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these dictionaries, the values are `None` because we never use them. As a result, we waste some storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides another built-in type, called a **set**, that behaves like a collection of dictionary keys with no values. Adding elements to a set is fast; so is checking membership. And sets provide methods and operators to compute common set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, set subtraction is available as a method called `difference` or as an operator, `-`. So we can rewrite `subtract` like this:\n",

    "        return set(d1) - set(d2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a set instead of a dictionary, but for operations like iteration, the behavior is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the exercises in this book can be done concisely and efﬁciently with sets. For example, here is a solution to `has_duplicates`, from Exercise 10.7, that uses a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def has_duplicates(t):\n",
    "        d = {}\n",

    "            d[x] = True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "\n",
    "When an element appears for the ﬁrst time, it is added to the dictionary. If the same element appears again, the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using sets, we can write the same function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def has_duplicates(t):\n",
    "        return len(set(t)) < len(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "An element can only appear in a set once, so if an element in `t` appears more than once, the set will be smaller than `t`. If there are no duplicates, the set will be the same size as `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use sets to do some of the exercises in Chapter 9. For example, here’s a version of `uses_only` with a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def uses_only(word, available):\n",

    "    def uses_only(word, available):\n",
    "        return set(word) <= set(available)\n",

    "The `<=` operator checks whether one set is a subset or another, including the possibility that they are equal, which is true if all the letters in word appear in `available`.\n",

    "    >>> printall(1, 2.0, third='3')\n",
