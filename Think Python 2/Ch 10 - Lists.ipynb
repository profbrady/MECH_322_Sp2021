    "\n",
    "## 10.1 A list is a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a string, a **list** is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called **elements** or sometimes **items**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets (`[` and `]`):\n",

    "    ['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']\n",

    "\n",
    "A list within another list is **nested**.\n",

    "    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n",
    "        numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop traverses the list and updates each element. `len` returns the number of elements in the list. `range` returns a list of indices from $0$ to $n − 1$, where $n$ is the length of the list. Each time through the loop `i` gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses `i` to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop over an empty list never runs the body:\n",

    "## 10.13 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most list methods modify the argument and return None. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you are used to writing string code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "        word = word.strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "  It is tempting to write list code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t = t.sort()             # WRONG!\n",
    "\n",
    "  Because `sort` returns `None`, the next operation you perform with `t` is likely to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pick an idiom and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use `pop`, `remove`, `del`, or even a slice assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To add an element, you can use the `append` method or the `+` operator. Assuming that `t` is a list and `x` is a list element, these are correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t.append(x)\n",
    "        t = t + [x]\n",
    "        t += [x]\n",
    "\n",
    "  And these are wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "        t.append([x])             # WRONG!\n",
    "        t = t.append(x)           # WRONG!\n",
    "        t + [x]                   # WRONG!\n",
    "        t = t + x                 # WRONG!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to use a method like sort that modiﬁes the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> t = [3, 1, 2]\n",
    "        >>> t2 = t[:]\n",
    "        >>> t2.sort()\n",
    "        >>> t\n",
    "        [3, 1, 2]\n",
    "        >>> t2\n",
    "        [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example you could also use the built-in function `sorted`, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> t2 = sorted(t)\n",
    "        >>> t\n",
    "        [3, 1, 2]\n",
