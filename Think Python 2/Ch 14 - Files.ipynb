    "\n",

    "    >>> x = 52\n",
    "    >>> fout.write(str(x))\n",

    "\n",
    "The ﬁrst operand is the **format string**, which contains one or more **format sequences**, which specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the format sequence '%d' means that the second operand should be formatted as a decimal integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> camels = 42\n",
    "    >>> '%d' % camels\n",
    "    '42'\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is the string `'42'`, which is not to be confused with the integer value `42`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    >>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels\n",
    "    'I have spotted 42 camels.'\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a tuple. Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example uses `'%d'` to format an integer, `'%g'` to format a ﬂoating-point number, and `'%s'` to format a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')\n",
    "    'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of elements in the tuple has to match the number of format sequences in the string. Also, the types of the elements have to match the format sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)\n",
    "    TypeError: not enough arguments for format string\n",
