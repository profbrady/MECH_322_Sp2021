    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it should create a new window with small arrow that represents the turtle. Close the window.\n",

    "    import turtle\n",
    "    bob = turtle.Turtle()\n",
    "    print(bob)\n",
    "    turtle.mainloop()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `turtle` module (with a lowercase ’t’) provides a function called `Turtle` (with an uppercase ’T’) that creates a `Turtle` object, which we assign to a variable named `bob`. Printing `bob` displays something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <turtle.Turtle object at 0xb7bfbf4c\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that `bob` refers to an object with type `Turtle` as deﬁned in module `turtle`. `mainloop` tells the window to wait for the user to do something, although in this case there’s not much for the user to do except close the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you create a Turtle, you can call a **method** to move it around the window. A method is similar to a function, but it uses slightly different syntax. For example, to move the turtle forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bob.fd(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "The method, `fd`, is associated with the `turtle` object we’re calling `bob`. Calling a method is like making a request: you are asking `bob` to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument of `fd` is a distance in pixels, so the actual size depends on your display. Other methods you can call on a Turtle are `bk` to move backward, `lt` for left turn, and `rt` right turn. The argument for `lt` and `rt` is an angle in degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves a trail when it moves. The methods `pu` and `pd` stand for “pen up” and “pen down”. To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program (after creating `bob` and before calling `mainloop`):\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called `square` that takes a parameter named `t`, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.\n",

    "    Write a function call that passes `bob` as an argument to `square`, and then run the program again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add another parameter, named `length`, to `square`. Modify the body so length of the sides is `length`, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for `length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a copy of `square` and change the name to `polygon`. Add another parameter named `n` and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. *Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function called `circle` that takes a turtle, `t`, and radius, `r`, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling `polygon` with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of `r`. *Hint: ﬁgure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that* `length * n = circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a more general version of `circle` called `arc` that takes an additional parameter `angle`, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. `angle` is in units of degrees, so when `angle=360`, `arc` should draw a complete circle."

    "## 4.4 Encapsulation\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside the function, `t` refers to the same turtle `bob`, so `t.lt(90)` has the same effect as `bob.lt(90)`. In that case, why not call the parameter bob? The idea is that `t` can be any turtle, not just `bob`, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to `square`:\n",

    "\n",
    "    def polygon(t, n, length):\n",
    "        angle = 360 / n for i in range(n):\n",

    "\n",
    "This example draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 2, the value of angle might be off because of integer division. A simple solution is to compute `angle = 360.0 / n`. Because the numerator is a ﬂoating-point number, the result is ﬂoating point.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called **keyword arguments** because they include the parameter names as “keywords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like `while` and `def`).\n",

    "\n",
    "One limitation of this solution is that `n` is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking `n` as a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls `circle`) more control, but the interface would be less clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **interface** of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the caller to do what they want without dealing with unnecessary details.\n",

    "In this example, `r` belongs in the interface because it speciﬁes the circle to be drawn. `n` is less appropriate because it pertains to the details of *how* the circle should be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of `n` depending on `circumference`:\n",

    "        length = circumference / n\n",
    "        polygon(t, n, length)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the number of segments is an integer near `circumference/3`, so the length of each segment is approximately 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient, and acceptable for any size circle.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.1.** Download the code in this chapter from http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program while executing `circle(bob, radius)`. You can do the arithmetic by hand or add print statements to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. The version of `arc` in Section 4.7 is not very accurate because the linear approximation of the circle is always outside the true circle. As a result, the Turtle ends up a few pixels away from the correct destination. My solution shows a way to reduce the effect of this error. Read the code and see if it makes sense to you. If you draw a diagram, you might see how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.2.** Write an appropriately general set of functions that can draw ﬂowers as in Figure 4.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/flower.py, also requires http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.3.** Write an appropriately general set of functions that can draw shapes as in Figure 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/pie.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.4.** The letters of the alphabet can be constructed from a moderate number of basic elements, like vertical and horizontal lines and a few curves. Design an alphabet that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw the letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write one function for each letter, with names `draw_a`, `draw_b`, etc., and put your functions in a ﬁle named `letters.py`. You can download a “turtle typewriter” from http://thinkpython2.com/code/typewriter.py to help you test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get a solution from http://thinkpython2.com/code/letters.py; it also requires http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 4.5.** Read about spirals at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral; then write a program that draws an Archimedian spiral (or one of the other kinds).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/spiral.py."
