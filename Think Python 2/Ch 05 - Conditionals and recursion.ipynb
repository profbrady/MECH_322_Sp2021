    "\n",
    "The ﬂoor division operator, `//`, divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer. For example, suppose the run time of a movie is 105 minutes. You might want to know how long that is in hours. Conventional division returns a ﬂoating-point number:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> minutes = 105\n",
    "    >>> minutes / 60\n",
    "    1.75\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don’t normally write hours with decimal points. Floor division returns the integer number of hours, dropping the fraction part:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> minutes = 105\n",
    "    >>> hours = minutes // 60\n",
    "    >>> hours 1\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the remainder, you could subtract off one hour in minutes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> remainder = minutes - hours * 60\n",
    "    >>> remainder 45\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use the modulus operator, `%`, which divides two numbers and returns the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> remainder = minutes % 60\n",
    "    >>> remainder 45\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulus operator is more useful than it seems. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another--if `x % y` is zero, then `x` is divisible by `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, `x % 10` yields the right-most digit of `x` (in base 10). Similarly `x % 100` yields the last two digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Python 2, division works differently. The division operator, `/`, performs ﬂoor division if both operands are integers, and ﬂoating-point division if either operand is a float."
