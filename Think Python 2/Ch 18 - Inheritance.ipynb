    "# Chapter 18: Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is **inheritance**. Inheritance is the ability to deﬁne a new class that is a modiﬁed version of an existing class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing cards, decks of cards, and poker hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker, but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code examples from this chapter are available from http://thinkpython2.com/code/ Card.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "18.1 Card objects\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ﬁfty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to deﬁne a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the attributes should be: rank and suit. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like 'Spade' for suits and 'Queen' for ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode” means that we are going to deﬁne a mapping between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be “encryption”).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      |            |  |\n",
    "|------|------------|--|\n",
    "|Spades| $\\mapsto{}$| 3|\n",
    "|Hearts| $\\mapsto{}$| 2|\n",
    "|Diamonds| $\\mapsto{}$| 1|\n",
    "|Clubs |$\\mapsto{}$| 0|\n",
    "\n",
    "This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:\n",
    "\n",
    "|      |            |  |\n",
    "|------|------------|--|\n",
    "|Jack| $\\mapsto{}$| 11|\n",
    "|Queen| $\\mapsto{}$| 12|\n",
    "|King| $\\mapsto{}$| 13|\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the $\\mapsto{}$ symbol to make it clear that these mappings are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class deﬁnition for Card looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "        suit_names = ['Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades']\n",

    "\n",
    "Variables like `suit_names` and `rank_names`, which are deﬁned inside a class but outside of any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object Card.\n",
    "\n",
    "This term distinguishes them from variables like `suit` and `rank`, which are called **instance attributes** because they are associated with a particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in `__str__`, self is a Card object, and `self.rank` is its rank. Similarly, `Card` is a class object, and `Card.rank_names` is a list of strings associated with the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every card has its own `suit` and `rank`, but there is only one copy of `suit_names` and `rank_names`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the expression `Card.rank_names[self.rank]` means “use the attribute `rank` from the object `self` as an index into the list `rank_names` from the class `Card`, and select the appropriate string.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The ﬁrst element of `rank_names` is `None` because there is no card with rank zero. By including `None` as a place-keeper, we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the string `'2'`, and so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have used a dictionary instead of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:\n",

    "\n",
    "For built-in types, there are relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.) that compare values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to another. For programmer-deﬁned types, we can override the behavior of the built-in operators by providing a method named `__lt__`, which stands for “less than”.\n",

    "\n",
    "The correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we’ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds, and so on.\n",

As an example, let’s say we want a class to represent a “hand”, that is, the cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a collection of cards, and both require operations like adding and removing cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don’t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.\n",

    "The previous chapters demonstrate a development plan we might call “object-oriented design”. We identiﬁed objects we needed--like `Point`, `Rectangle` and `Time`--and deﬁned classes to represent them. In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some entity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world).\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In that case you need a different development plan. In the same way that we discovered function interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover class interfaces by **data encapsulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov analysis, from Section 13.8, provides a good example. If you download my code from http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py, you’ll see that it uses two global variables--`suffix_map` and `prefix`--that are read and written from several functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    suffix_map = {}\n",
    "    prefix = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these variables are global, we can only run one analysis at a time. If we read two texts, their preﬁxes and sufﬁxes would be added to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting generated text).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each analysis in an object. Here’s what that looks like:\n",
    "\n",

    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.suffix_map = {}\n",
    "            self.prefix = ()\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we transform the functions into methods. For example, here’s `process_word`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def process_word(self, word, order=2):\n",
    "        if len(self.prefix) < order:\n",

    "Transforming a program like this--changing the design without changing the behavior--is another example of refactoring (see Section 4.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example suggests a development plan for designing objects and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by writing functions that read and write global variables (when necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once you get the program working, look for associations between global variables and the functions that use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transform the associated functions into methods of the new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, download my Markov code from http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py, and follow the steps described above to encapsulate the global variables as attributes of a new class called `Markov`. Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/Markov.py (note the capital M)."
