    "## 16.2 Pure functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we’ll write two functions that add time values. They demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and modiﬁers. They also demonstrate a development plan I’ll call **prototype and patch**, which is a way of tackling a complex problem by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple prototype of `add_time`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "        sum = Time()\n",
    "        sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour\n",
    "        sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute\n",
    "        sum.second = t1.second + t2.second\n",
    "        return sum\n",
    "\n",
    "The function creates a new `Time` object, initializes its attributes, and returns a reference to the new object. This is called a **pure function** because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments and it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this function, I’ll create two Time objects: `start` contains the start time of a movie, like *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, and `duration` contains the run time of the movie, which is one hour 35 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`add_time` ﬁgures out when the movie will be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> start = Time()\n",
    "    >>> start.hour = 9\n",
    "    >>> start.minute = 45\n",
    "    >>> start.second = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> duration = Time()\n",
    "    >>> duration.hour = 1\n",
    "    >>> duration.minute = 35\n",
    "    >>> duration.second = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> done = add_time(start, duration)\n",
    "    >>> print_time(done)\n",
    "    10:80:00\n",
    "\n",
    "The result, `10:80:00` might not be what you were hoping for. The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. When that happens, we have to “carry” the extra seconds into the minute column or the extra minutes into the hour column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an improved version:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "        sum = Time()\n",
    "        sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour\n",

    "## 16.3 Modiﬁers\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as parameters. In that case, the changes are visible to the caller. Functions that work this way are called **modiﬁers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`increment`, which adds a given number of seconds to a `Time` object, can be written naturally as a modiﬁer. Here is a rough draft:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def increment(time, seconds):\n",
    "        time.second += seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "        if time.second >= 60:\n",

    "            time.minute += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        if time.minute >= 60:\n",
    "            time.minute -= 60\n",
    "            time.hour += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The ﬁrst line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the special cases we saw before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this function correct? What happens if `seconds` is much greater than sixty?\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to keep doing it until `time.second` is less than sixty. One solution is to replace the if statements with `while` statements. That would make the function correct, but not very efﬁcient. As an exercise, write a correct version of increment that doesn’t contain any loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that can be done with modiﬁers can also be done with pure functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modiﬁers. But modiﬁers are convenient at times, and functional programs tend to be less efﬁcient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort to modiﬁers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a **functional programming style**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, write a “pure” version of `increment` that creates and returns a new Time object rather than modifying the parameter."

    "## 16.4 Prototyping versus planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The development plan I am demonstrating is called “prototype and patch”. For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding of the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily complicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to know if you have found all the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is **designed development**, in which high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit number in base 60 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal.)! The `second` attribute is the “ones column”, the `minute` attribute is the “sixties column”, and the `hour` attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column”.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we wrote `add_time` and `increment`, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem--we can convert Time objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a function that converts Times to integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def time_to_int(time):\n",
    "        minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute\n",
    "        seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second\n",
    "        return seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a function that converts an integer to a Time (recall that `divmod` divides the ﬁrst argument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).\n",
    "\n",
    "    def int_to_time(seconds):\n",
    "        time = Time()\n",
    "        minutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)\n",
    "        time.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)\n",
    "        return time\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to check that `time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x` for many values of `x`. This is an example of a consistency check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite `add_time`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "        seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)\n",
    "        return int_to_time(seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify. As an exercise, rewrite `increment` using `time_to_int` and `int_to_time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of writing the conversion functions (`time_to_int` and `int_to_time`), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two Times to ﬁnd the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error)."
