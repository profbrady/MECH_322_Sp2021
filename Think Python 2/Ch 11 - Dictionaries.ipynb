    "# Chapter 11: Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter presents another built-in type called a dictionary. Dictionaries are one of Python’s best features; they are the building blocks of many efﬁcient and elegant algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.1 A dictionary is a mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dictionary** is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can be (almost) any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called **keys**, and a collection of values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is called a **key-value pair** or sometimes an **item**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a **mapping** from keys to values, so you can also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `dict` creates a new dictionary with no items. Because `dict` is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp = dict()\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp\n",
    "    {}\n",
    "\n",
    "The squiggly-brackets, `{}`, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "\n",
    "This line creates an item that maps from the key `'one'` to the value `'uno'`. If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp {'one': 'uno'}\n",
    "\n",
    "This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you print `eng2sp`, you might be surprised:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp\n",
    "    {'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the key-value pairs might not be the same. If you type the same example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp['two']\n",
    "    'dos'\n",
    "\n",
    "The key `'two'` always maps to the value `'dos'` so the order of the items doesn’t matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> eng2sp['four']\n",
    "    KeyError: 'four'\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len` function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> len(eng2sp)\n",
    "    3\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` operator works on dictionaries, too; it tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> 'one' in eng2sp\n",
    "    True\n",
    "    >>> 'uno' in eng2sp\n",
    "    False\n",
    "\n",
    "To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method `values`, which returns a collection of values, and then use the `in` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> vals = eng2sp.values()\n",
    "    >>> 'uno' in vals\n",
    "    True\n",
    "\n",
    "The `in` operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it searches the elements of the list in order, as in Section 8.6. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a **hashtable** that has a remarkable property: the `in` operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items are in the dictionary. I explain how that’s possible in Section B.4, but the explanation might not make sense until you’ve read a few more chapters."

    "## 11.2 Dictionary as a collection of counters\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function `ord`), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The ﬁrst time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **implementation** is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the code might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def histogram(s):\n",
    "        d = dict() for c in s:\n",
    "            if c not in d:\n",
    "                d[c] = 1\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                d[c] += 1\n",
    "        return d\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function is `histogram`, which is a statistical term for a collection of counters (or frequencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ﬁrst line of the function creates an empty dictionary. The `for` loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character `c` is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key `c` and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If `c` is already in the dictionary we increment `d[c]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> h = histogram('brontosaurus')\n",
    "    >>> h\n",
    "    {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram indicates that the letters `'a'` and `'b'` appear once; `'o'` appears twice, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries have a method called `get` that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, `get` returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> h = histogram('a')\n",
    "    >>> h {'a': 1}\n",
    "    >>> h.get('a', 0)\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    >>> h.get('b', 0)\n",
    "    0\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, use `get` to write histogram more concisely. You should be able to eliminate the `if` statement."

Depending on the application, you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. Second, there is no simple syntax to do a **reverse lookup**; you have to search.\n",

    "## 11.5 Dictionaries and lists\n",

    "Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you are given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be a list of letters.\n",

    "        return inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time through the loop, `key` gets a key from `d` and `val` gets the corresponding value. If `val` is not in `inverse`, that means we haven’t seen it before, so we create a new item and initialize it with a **singleton** (a list that contains a single element). Otherwise we have seen this value before, so we append the corresponding key to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> hist = histogram('parrot')\n",
    "    >>> hist\n",

    "    >>> inverse\n",
    "    {1: ['a', 'p', 't', 'o'], 2: ['r']}\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 11.1 is a state diagram showing `hist` and `inverse`. A dictionary is represented as a box with the type `dict` above it and the key-value pairs inside. If the values are integers, ﬂoats or strings, I draw them inside the box, but I usually draw lists outside the box, just to keep the diagram simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be values in a dictionary, as this example shows, but they cannot be keys. Here’s what happens if you try:\n",
    "\n",

    "    TypeError: list objects are unhashable\n",
    "\n",
    "I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be **hashable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hash** is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system works ﬁne if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to ﬁnd a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.\n",

    "## 11.8 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scale down the input:** If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text ﬁle, start with just the ﬁrst 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can ﬁnd. You can either edit the ﬁles themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the ﬁrst n lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you ﬁnd and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check summaries and types:** Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write self-checks:** Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format the output:** Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an example in Section 6.9. Another tool you might ﬁnd useful is the pprint module, which provides a pprint function that displays built-in types in a more humanreadable format (pprint stands for “pretty print”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging."

When you remove the ﬁrst letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the ﬁrst letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?\n",

Let’s look at the ﬁve-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the ﬁrst letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\n",
    "\n",
