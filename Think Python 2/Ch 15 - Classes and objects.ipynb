    "At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to organize data. The next step is to learn “object-oriented programming”, which uses programmerdeﬁned types to organize both code and data. Object-oriented programming is a big topic; it will take a few chapters to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code examples from this chapter are available from http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1.py; solutions to the exercises are available from http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1_soln.py.\n",

    "## 15.1 Programmer-deﬁned types\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used many of Python’s built-in types; now we are going to deﬁne a new type. As an example, we will create a type called `Point` that represents a point in two-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, $(0, 0)$ represents the origin, and $( x, y)$ represents the point $x$ units to the right and $y$ units up from the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways we might represent points in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could create a new type to represent points as objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer-deﬁned type is also called a **class**. A class deﬁnition looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Point:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Represents a point in 2-D space.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The header indicates that the new class is called `Point`. The body is a docstring that explains what the class is for. You can deﬁne variables and methods inside a class deﬁnition, but we will get back to that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deﬁning a class named `Point` creates a **class object**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> Point\n",
    "    <class '__main__.Point'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `Point` is deﬁned at the top level, its “full name” is `__main__.Point`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class object is like a factory for creating objects. To create a Point, you call `Point` as if it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> blank = Point()\n",
    "    >>> blank\n",
    "    <__main__.Point object at 0xb7e9d3ac>\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is a reference to a Point object, which we assign to `blank`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new object is called **instantiation**, and the object is an **instance** of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you print an instance, Python tells you what class it belongs to and where it is stored in memory (the preﬁx `0x` means that the following number is in hexadecimal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object is an instance of some class, so “object” and “instance” are interchangeable. But in this chapter I use “instance” to indicate that I am talking about a programmerdeﬁned type."

    "\n",
    "    >>> blank.x = 3.0\n",
    "    >>> blank.y = 4.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a module, such as `math.pi` or `string.whitespace`. In this case, though, we are assigning values to named elements of an object. These elements are called **attributes**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows the result of these assignments. A state diagram that shows an object and its attributes is called an **object diagram**; see Figure 15.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `blank` refers to a Point object, which contains two attributes. Each attribute refers to a ﬂoating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> blank.y\n",
    "    4.0\n",
    "    >>> x = blank.x\n",
    "    >>> x\n",
    "    3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `blank.x` means, “Go to the object `blank` refers to and get the value of `x`.” In the example, we assign that value to a variable named `x`. There is no conﬂict between the variable `x` and the attribute `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use dot notation as part of any expression. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> '(%g, %g)' % (blank.x, blank.y)\n",
    "    '(3.0, 4.0)'\n",
    "    >>> distance = math.sqrt(blank.x**2 + blank.y**2)\n",
    "    >>> distance\n",
    "    5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def print_point(p):\n",
    "        print('(%g, %g)' % (p.x, p.y))\n",
    "\n",
    "`print_point` takes a point as an argument and displays it in mathematical notation. To invoke it, you can pass `blank` as an argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> print_point(blank)\n",
    "    (3.0, 4.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, `p` is an alias for `blank`, so if the function modiﬁes `p`, `blank` changes.\n",

In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for instances, the default behavior of the `==` operator is the same as the `is` operator; it checks object identity, not object equivalence.
